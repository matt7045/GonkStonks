Click **_run.bat_** to open up our state-of-the-art GUI, which allows you to **buy** GME. There is a glitch with robinhood, where you can only sell, so we decided to fix this with our state of the art program. (Of course, you can sell it like normal through the Alpaca UI at any time. But HOLD THE DAMN LINE.) 

**Note: Windows 10 blocks .bat programs from running by default. Clicking "run anyway" runs it, anyway.**
